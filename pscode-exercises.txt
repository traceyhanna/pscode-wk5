// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Print Addition (4+5)

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Input #
If # > 0 && #%2 = WholeNumber 
  then PRINT Even
Else PRINT Odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Select a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4, e=5   
b) (a+b+c+d+e)/5 = Average(AVG)
c) IF A = 1, then 
      if A > B, then A = A
      		Else, A = B
      	if A > C, then A = A
      		Else, A = C
      		if A > D, then A = A
      			Else, A = D 
      			if A > E, then A = A
      				Else A = E
    THEN Print A is MIN 

    IF A = 1, then 
    	if A < B, then A = A
    		ELSE, A = B
    	if A < C, then A = A 
    		ELSE, A = C
    	if A < D, then A = A
    		ELSE, A = D
    	if A < E, then A = A 
    		ELSE, A = E
    THEN Print A is MAX


d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are
PRINT "AVG" is the sum of A + B + C + D + E divided by 5, or the average.  "MIN" is the smallest number between A and E, and "MAX" is the greatest number between A and E
